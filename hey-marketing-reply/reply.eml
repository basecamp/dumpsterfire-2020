HEY! Thanks for emailing our dumpster fire.

Our team of scientists is busy reviewing your email to make sure it meets our experiment protocols. Safety first! We’ll also make sure it isn’t hateful, threatening, harassing, or otherwise bogus. If everything looks good, we may queue it up for printing and combustion. You can monitor progress live at <a href="https://dumpsterfire.email/">dumpsterfire.email</a>, but don’t worry if you miss it. We’ll send you another email with a clip of your burn after it happens.

- the H.E.R.L team

PS: We made this experiment for fun, but we made HEY to make email better. Give it a try at <a href="https://hey.com?utm_source=HERL&utm_medium=email">HEY.com</a>.
